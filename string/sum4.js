// You have two strings stored in variables. Concatenate them into a single string. For example, if str1 = "JavaScript is fun" and str2 = "and very useful.", concatenate them to produce: "JavaScript is fun and very useful.".
let str1="JavaScript is fun";
let str2="and very useful";
let concat=str1+" "+str2;
console.log(concat);
