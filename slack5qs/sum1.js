// 1. Write a program to check if the character is a vowel, print "The character is a vowel." If the character is a consonant, print "The character is a consonant." Make sure to handle both upper and lower case letters. A vowel is a character which is any of letters a, e, i, o, u. Any letter which is a not a vowel is considered a consonant.
let alp="a";
if(alp=="a" || alp=="e" || alp=="i" || alp=="o" || alp=="u"|| alp=="A" || alp=="E" || alp=="I"||alp=="O"||alp=="U"){
console.log("The character is a vowel")
}
else{
    console.log("It is consonant");
}
